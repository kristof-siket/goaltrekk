Project for tracking goals, only works on local system at the moment (backend is simulated wit JSON Server). 


For compiling my JavaScript, I use Webpack, and the Starter Pack developed by Brad Traversy ([Traversy Media](http://www.traversymedia.com)). 

Many thanks to him, and also for his Modern Javascript course in udemy. s
